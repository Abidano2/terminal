        <h3>Status Updates:</h3>

	<h4>7 NOV 2021</h4>
	<p>
		Hey! As you can tell by the progress bar, progress has been made. 
		<br>
		<br>
		If you couldn't tell already, yes this is a game. This game currently doesn't have a name so I'll be calling it Project Atlas for now. It will be divided in "Chapters" with each one being more than an hour long.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have a team helping with this including 2 other story writers and an artist, the rest is being handled by me.
		<br>
		<br>
		Almost half of Chapter 1 has been written. After I'm done writing it we'll start writing multiple chapters in parallel with me writing Chapter 2 and the other writers writing Chapters 3 and 4, with me helping of course. After Chapter 1 is finished I'd like to release it as a demo, I don't know when that will happen though. I'd also like to expand the team a little more by getting a musician and a second programmer. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Other than that, here are some numbered estimations of progress so far:
	<br>
	<br>
	CHAPTER 1:
		<br>
		<br>
		Design - 
		<br>
			Story and progression: 40%
		<br>
			Characters: 50%(?)
		<br>
			Battle Mechanics: 10%
		<br>
			Maps: 20%
		<br>
			Cutscenes: 20%
		<br>
		<br>

		Implementation -
		<br>
			Art: 0%
		<br>
			Cutscenes: 0%
		<br>
			Dialogue: 10%
		<br>
			Maps: 0%
		<br>
			Battles: 0%
		<br>
			(The first Act of Chapter 1 was actually almost complete but a little oopsie happened and most of the stuff is back to 0...)
	<br>
	<br>
	CHAPTER 2+:
		<br>
		<br>
		Design -
		<br>
			General Story: 88%
		<br>
			Main Characters: 100% (All Bosses are known) 
		<br>
			General Locations and Themes: 100%
		<br>
		<br>

		Implementation - 0%
		<br>
		<br>

		Overall, the game is still very early in development so I have no idea when the first chapter will be completed. Since everything is being made from scratch at the moment, after Chapter 1 is completed we'll use that as a base and things should then speed up.
		<br>
		<br>
		So yeah. The next status update will probably be when Chapter 1 is finished so it's going to be a while.
